# `haproxy_autconf`
Welcome to `haproxy_autconf` ðŸŽ‰

`haproxy_autconf` is a container that manages automatic backend registration and deregistration. It is designed to be
run together with your real backend services so that they are registered automatically once you call `docker-compose up`
and deregistered if the services go down.

## Example
See the [Docker-Compose.yml](Docker-Compose.yml) file as example.
